## Known Issues

- ~~Rare instances where overlay will remain even when there are no people chopping the tree~~
  - Potentially resolved via [#6](https://github.com/Infinitay/tree-count-plugin/pull/6)
  - If you encounter this issue, please open an issue with the tree's location and a description of what happened

## Future Plans

- When part 2 of the forestry event is release, add the new axe animation ids to #isWoodcutting
